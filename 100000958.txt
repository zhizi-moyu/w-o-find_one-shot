    'flanged_split_bushing': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A cylindrical bushing with a wide flange at one end. The cylindrical body is split along its length into two symmetrical halves, allowing for compression or expansion. The flange is flat and circular, with a central hole. The split design suggests it is used for press-fitting or alignment in a housing.'
    },
    'slotted_retaining_ring': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A ring-shaped component with a flange and a slotted cylindrical body. The cylindrical section has a vertical slot cut through it, allowing for slight flexibility. The flange is slightly raised and flat, providing a stop or locking surface. The inner bore is hollow, likely for shaft or pin insertion.'
    },
    'cylindrical_flanged_sleeve': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A simple cylindrical sleeve with a flat flange at one end. The sleeve is hollow and smooth, with no visible slots or cuts. The flange is slightly wider than the cylinder and provides a stop or mounting surface. This component likely serves as a spacer, guide, or bearing surface.'
    },
    'conical_centered_disk': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A disk-shaped component with a conical or tapered central hole. The outer surface is flat and circular, while the central hole appears to be chamfered or conical, possibly for centering or guiding a fastener or shaft. The back side is slightly recessed, giving it a shallow cylindrical profile.'
    },
    'split_flanged_socket': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A socket-like cylindrical component with a wide flange and two internal split arms. The inner cavity is hollow and has a central hole at the base. The two internal arms are symmetrically spaced and extend inward, possibly for gripping or alignment. The flange is flat and circular, providing a mounting or stop surface.'
    },
    'dual_leg_flanged_insert': {
        'num': '1',
        'description': 'A cylindrical insert with a wide flange and two protruding legs or tabs extending from the base. The flange is flat and circular with a central hole. The cylindrical body is solid, and the two legs are spaced apart, likely for alignment or locking into another component. The central hole may serve as a guide or fastener passage.'
