One end of the plate is rounded with a small semicircular protrusion, while the opposite end tapers into a sharp angled point. The side edges are irregular, with one side having a slight concave curve and the other side featuring a small notch or indentation. The top and bottom surfaces are flat and parallel, giving the component a uniform thickness. The material appears to be a light-colored plastic or resin, and the surface is smooth with no visible texture or fasteners. The overall shape suggests it may be a keying or interlocking part in a larger assembly, possibly used for alignment or positioning.'
