The outer surface has two recessed hexagonal holes for set screws, and the body is split axially on both ends with a narrow slit to allow clamping action when the screws are tightened. The slits extend partially along the length of the cylinder, providing flexibility for clamping. The ends of the cylinder are flat, and the overall surface is smooth with a matte metallic finish.'
