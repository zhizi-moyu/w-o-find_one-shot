This part includes a protruding tab or interlocking feature that fits into the vertical cutout of the outer shell, allowing for rotational or sliding movement. The joint is likely responsible for transmitting torque or motion between connected parts.'

The bore is circular and centered, likely used for alignment or to allow a shaft or rod to pass through. The ring is integrated into the inner rotary joint or may be a separate sleeve that fits concentrically within the assembly.'
