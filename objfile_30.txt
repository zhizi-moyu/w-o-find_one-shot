These ribs likely serve for grip, heat dissipation, or structural reinforcement. The sleeve is slightly raised from the central body and appears to be a separate, slide-on component.'

These lugs are likely used for locking or alignment purposes. The face plate is flush with the body and has a central circular opening.'

        'num': '3',
        'description': 'Three identical hexagonal bolt heads located on the rear face plate. They are arranged in a triangular pattern around the central socket. These bolts likely secure the rear face plate to the central body or hold internal components in place.'
