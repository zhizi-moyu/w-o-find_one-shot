The top part of this cylinder is embedded into the cavity of the larger cylinder, while the bottom part protrudes slightly. The diameter is smaller than the recess, creating a visible step or lip around the base. The height is less than the height of the large cylinder, and it appears to be a press-fit or fixed insert.'
